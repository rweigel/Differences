The following codes create a cartesian grid structure, retrieve Bz, Jx, rho, Ux from specific data files, performs an interpolation onto the grid using Kameleon, calculate the percent difference, and outputs a .vtk file.

reader.cpp
    - gathers variables from /mnt/Disk2 subdirectories and creates .vtk output files in the /mnt/Disk2 subdirectories
    
diff.cpp
    - gathers variables from /mnt/Disk2 subdirectories and calculates percent differences for all variables, then places the result files in /mnt/Disk2/Results.
    
pcdiff.cpp
    - gathers variables from /mnt/Disk2/Precondition (specific to the preconditioning case used in Brian Curtis' thesis) and calculates percent differences for all variables, then places the result files in /mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results
