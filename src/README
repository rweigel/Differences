## Overview

The following codes create a cartesian grid structure, extract parameters from simulation data files, performs an interpolation onto the grid using Kameleon, calculates the percent difference, and outputs a .vtk file for each time step.

## Compiling

The most difficult step is compilation. The Kameleon libraries require CDF, HDF5, and Boost. Copies of the source code of the libraries that all worked on a system with ... are used. The individual libraries can be build using

```
make cdf
make hdf
make boost
make kameleon
```

and then

```
make reader
```

## Running

Request CDF data files in CCMC interface. When they are ready, execute from this directory

```
make ID
```

where `ID` is the run id in the URL of the data files sent by CCMC when the files are ready. For exmaple, if the CCMC data files are stored at `https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/RoR_WWW/output_files/Brian_Curtis_042213_2`, then execute

```
make Brian_Curtis_042213_2
```

## Code Description

`reader.cpp` - Reads MHD files in `../data/ID` and outputs `VTK` or `ASCII` output files in subdirectories of ../disk. The VTK files are on the grid specified in `grid.h`. The ASCII files are on the same grid, but in the `y=0` plane.
    
`diff.cpp` -  Reads from ../disk subdirectories and calculates percent differences for all variables, then places the result files in ../disk/Results.
    
`pcdiff.cpp` - Reads from ../disk/Precondition (specific to the preconditioning case used in Brian Curtis' thesis) and calculates percent differences for all variables, then places the result files in ../disk/Precondition/Results
