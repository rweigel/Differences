The following codes create a cartesian grid structure, extracts Bz, Jx, rho, Ux from run data files, performs an interpolation onto the grid using Kameleon, calculate the percent difference, and output a .vtk file for each time step.

Data files are assumed to be in ../disk, but this directory may be set as an argument to executables.

All files are assumed to have extension .cdf (not .cdf.gz).

reader.cpp
    - Reads from ../disk subdirectories and creates .vtk output files in subdirectories of ../disk
    
diff.cpp
    - Reads from ../disk subdirectories and calculates percent differences for all variables, then places the result files in ../disk/Results.
    
pcdiff.cpp
    - Reads from ../disk/Precondition (specific to the preconditioning case used in Brian Curtis' thesis) and calculates percent differences for all variables, then places the result files in ../disk/Precondition/Results
