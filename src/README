The following codes start out by creating a personalized cartesian grid structure, retrieves Bz, Jx, rho, Ux variables from specific data files, performs a kameleon interpolation from each run onto the personalized cartesian grid, calculates the percent difference if required, then outputs a .vtk file for the user to open via Paraview.

Each file differs as follows:

Reader.cpp
    - gathers variables from /mnt/Disk2 subdirectories and creates .vtk output files in the /mnt/Disk2 subdirectories
    
Diff.cpp
    - gathers variables from /mnt/Disk2 subdirectories and calculates percent differences for all variables, then places the result files in /mnt/Disk2/Results.
    
pcdiff.cpp
    - gathers variables from /mnt/Disk2/Precondition (specific to the preconditioning case used in Brian Curtis' thesis) and calculates percent differences foll variables, then places the result files in /mnt/Disk2/Precondition/Results
