The following codes create a cartesian grid structure, retrieve Bz, Jx, rho, Ux from specific data files, performs an interpolation onto the grid using Kameleon, calculate the percent difference, and outputs a .vtk file.

Data files are assumed to be in ../disk, but this directory may be set as an argument to executables.

If gzip file is found, it is unzipped, read, and then the uncompressed version is removed.

If FILANEME.cdf.gz and FILENAME.cdf files are both found, FILENAME.cdf.gz is not processed.
If FILANEME.cdf.gz is found and FILENAME.cdf is not found files are both found, FILENAME.cdf is deleted after processing.

reader.cpp
    - Reads from ../disk subdirectories and creates .vtk output files in subdirectories of ../disk
    
diff.cpp
    - Reads from ../disk subdirectories and calculates percent differences for all variables, then places the result files in ../disk/Results.
    
pcdiff.cpp
    - Reads from ../disk/Precondition (specific to the preconditioning case used in Brian Curtis' thesis) and calculates percent differences for all variables, then places the result files in ../disk/Precondition/Results
